# ⚛ React Refresher

React is vast, but concepts we covered are the fundamental building blocks of React. On this page you will find all the links you need regarding the _CodeSandbox_ examples we used and links to the starter projects & resources.

## Concepts Covered

[Official React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) - HTML in Javascript
- [Components & Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- **State**
  - [State](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
  - [useState Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
  - [Functional/Stateless Components in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components)
    _Note:_ Examples given in the React docs on these pages are written using class-based/stateful components. The examples provided use functional/stateless components. Attaching another link here so that you can revise the difference between the two methods, for creating components in React.

## Additional Reading

- [Planning your React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- [Building Forms with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- *Note:* It is suggested that you build a form in Vanilla JS first and then try to replicate the same thing using React.
